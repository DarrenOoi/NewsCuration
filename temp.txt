- More reliable than news
- Heavily left sided as they are mainly influenced by them.
- There is a significant left wing presence 
- I think you could trust it more 30 years ago because importers had more integrity. Now you don't know whether it is an opinion piece or actual reporting. And you have government agencies like Russia and China that intentionally report false information.
- biased and untrustworthy. Trying to push their own political agenda instead of reporting actual events. 
- horrible, completely not trust worthy.
- social media has helped broaden the audience to unbiased media. But TV particularly news corp has definitely caused some bias. 
- I think they are more concerned with social media engagement and "viralness" then reporting actual news
