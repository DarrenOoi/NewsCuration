HEADING: Biden crime family: Democrats, media resort to ‘nothing to see’

The House GOP investigation “needs to end now,” NYC’s own Rep. Dan Goldman told CNN; it’s nothing but “badgering a private citizen,” Hunter Biden, with “no legitimate legislative purpose at all.”

And looking into Hunter’s (now sidelined) plea deal is just “the taxpayer-funded defense and political arm of Donald Trump.”

Um, no. For starters, asking why the Justice Department sought an utterly unprecedented plea bargain that would’ve given President Joe Biden’s son blanket immunity for any crimes (not just the ones he was pleading to) plainly has a “legitimate legislative purpose”: It’s called “oversight.”

At the very least, someone needs to explain Justice letting the statute of limitations expire on Hunter’s most blatant tax violations when the evidence was already ample.

And why, five years on, it’s still silent on his failure to register as a foreign agent, when that “work” was how he “earned” those millions.

Thanks to the GOP probes, whistleblowers and other witnesses are still providing new and damning information on both Hunter’s influence-peddling and Joe’s collusion in it, as well as Justice interference in the Republican investigations.

Even if then-Veep Biden never directly promised any results to Hunter’s overseas clients, he surely knew what signal he sent by getting on the phone — dozens of times, per Devon Archer — with Hunter and the clients, even for meaningless chit-chat.

And with most of the Biden family getting paid (a total in tens of millions!) by those clients, and Hunter’s finances (at least) mingled with Joe’s, there’s plenty of reason to suspect a pro quo as well as a quid in all this.

Nor is any of this about Trump, even if he winds up the 2024 GOP nominee — not unless Goldman & Co. start claiming that all the investigations of Trump are just gifts to Biden.

The media wing of the “nothing there” movement is every bit as slimy: The New York Times story on Devon Archer’s testimony Monday suddenly asserts, “It has long been known that the elder Mr. Biden at times interacted with his son’s business partners,” even as the same story elsewhere admits, “In 2019, Mr. Biden also repeatedly said he had ‘never discussed’ and had ‘never spoken to’ Hunter Biden about his business dealings.”

In other words: This is old news, though the Times itself never mentioned it.

Bottom line: As he moves to run for a second term, evidence keeps building that the sitting president abused his power to enrich his family, then lied repeatedly about it — even as the Justice Department did its best to whitewash it all and let Hunter skate.

That’s a long, long way from “nothing.”
